Location-based Information
The information is optimized based on the user’s location or registered areas. We
receive disaster data directly through a dedicated line connected to the
Meteorological Service Support Center and collaborate with various agencies to
provide timely and comprehensive alerts. This will enable us to offer some of the
fastest disaster notifications in India.
➔ Accessibility Features
One major focus is accessibility, ensuring everyone can receive information in the
format that best suits them. For example, we offer a voice reading function and color
schemes adapted for different types of color vision. Another priority is reachability. No
matter how refined the user interface or how advanced the technology is, if the app’s
servers crash during a disaster, it’s useless. Ensuring that people can quickly and
reliably access information is crucial. We also enable the customization of the color
scheme based on individual color vision types.
➔ Server Optimization
When an earthquake hits, millions of requests flood in simultaneously, making it
extremely challenging to handle. At PRISM, we use cloud technology and caching to
return responses quickly.
For instance, we don’t have a login feature because it would require server-side
processing for data retrieval, increasing the risk of server crashes. We’ve also
avoided ads, as loading them places additional strain on the network, causing delays.
➔ Single-Flight Mechanism
We implemented a single-flight mechanism. Normally, every request would fetch data
from the backend, which isn’t feasible with the number of simultaneous requests we
get during a disaster. Instead, we group identical requests and fetch data from the
backend only once, then share that response with all grouped requests. This
significantly reduces the server load and allows us to handle high traffic with fewer
resources.
➔ Notification Mechanisms
We aim for comfortable notifications. For example, with flood alerts, water levels
fluctuate constantly, and high tides can temporarily push levels past the danger
threshold. If we sent a notification every time this happened, users would get
overwhelmed. So, we limit notifications to one initial alert or exclude them entirely if
we can determine it’s caused by tidal changes rather than a flood risk.

CYCLONE:-
Cyclone Genesis Forecasting: Using AI-driven models, PRISM predicts cyclone
formation, both in the short-term and long-term, providing sufficient lead time for
authorities to initiate emergency responses. These forecasts are based on historical
cyclone data, global atmospheric, and oceanic conditions.
2. Cyclone Path Prediction with Dynamic Correction: PRISM utilizes deep learning
to predict the path of a cyclone with high accuracy, continuously refining these
predictions using real-time data and advanced similarity searches. This ensures that
warnings are updated as new information becomes available.
3. Impact Forecasting: The system forecasts the cyclone's weather impact, including
wind speeds, rainfall intensity, and storm surges. PRISM uses this information to
create spatial-temporal impact maps, identifying areas most likely to experience
significant damage.
4. Hydrological Flood Forecasting: Coupling rainfall data with hydrological models,
PRISM predicts potential flood risks during cyclone events. The system generates
early alerts on flood-prone areas, allowing authorities to take proactive measures to
safeguard lives and property.
5. Real-Time Data Integration for Disaster Response: PRISM integrates multi-source
data, including satellite imagery, government agency reports, and social media
to monitor cyclone effects in real-time. The system’s machine learning algorithms
analyze this data to assist disaster response teams in mobilizing resources efficiently.
6. Tracking Population Movement: By utilizing Call Detail Records (CDR) and
Mobile Positioning Data (MPD), PRISM tracks the movement of populations during
Disseminating Alerts and Warnings: PRISM ensures that warnings and
instructions are delivered across different communication channels such as Google
Maps, smartphone notifications, and SMS alerts for those without internet access.
Partnering with local aid organizations ensures that no one is left without critical
information during a disaster.

floods:-
The PRISM app monitors real-time rainfall data and compares it to average levels
to detect potential flooding. If an area experiences excessive rainfall, the app
generates early alerts for nearby low-lying or high-risk areas.
PRISM notifies users to prepare by purchasing essential items, avoiding risky
outdoor activities, and ensuring they are ready for possible evacuation, ensuring they
remain safe in flood-prone areas.
● By integrating real-time data and AI-powered predictions, PRISM empowers users
with the tools they need for flood preparedness, significantly reducing the risk and
impact of floods

Earthquakes:-
Earthquake Detection and Forecasting: According to the U.S. Geological
Survey (USGS) and other experts, predicting earthquakes with precision is not
currently possible. As a result, scientists can only provide forecasts based on
seismic activity patterns and historical data, rather than exact predictions. The
app will integrate with global seismic data sources and real-time earthquake
monitoring systems. Using seismograph data, the app will detect the magnitude,
epicenter, and depth of earthquakes as soon as they occur. It will analyze historical
earthquake patterns, focusing on active tectonic zones like the Himalayas and
Arakan Yoma fold belt, to predict potential earthquake-prone areas. Machine
learning algorithms will continuously learn from this data, improving the accuracy of
earthquake predictions.
2. Impact Assessment and Early Warning: With real-time seismic data, the app will
issue early warnings based on the earthquake’s intensity and proximity to

populated areas. By utilizing AI and geospatial analysis, the app can model the
expected impact of the earthquake, helping users assess the danger in their specific
region. It will also provide estimated damage areas and aftershock predictions,
giving people enough time to take precautionary actions like evacuating buildings or
finding safe spots.
3. Post-Earthquake Guidance and Resource Management: After an earthquake, the
app will offer real-time updates on infrastructure damage, available emergency
shelters, and health and safety protocols. It will provide first-aid tips, rescue
operations status, and guide users on safe evacuation routes. Additionally, it will
assess critical infrastructure like roads, bridges, and hospitals, offering information
on the nearest available resources.
4. Data Integration and Community Engagement: The app will use social media
monitoring and crowdsourced data from users to track real-time information about
earthquake aftermath, such as damage reports or injured people, and to coordinate
community responses. Which works same as the store review for example when
earthquake will hit people there can share there experience on how they felt and
attach video/images with it so other people can view the damages . It will also enable
geo-tagged damage reports, helping authorities assess the affected areas quickly.
This system will be enhanced with Call Detail Records (CDRs) and mobile
positioning data (MPD) to track populations' movement and provide customized
recommendations based on their locations.
5. Resource and Relief Mobilization: The app will provide guidance on emergency
kits, rescue operations, and safe shelters, ensuring users have access to real-time
disaster relief information. Based on real-time updates, it will suggest routes for
rescue teams and relief supplies, helping aid organizations better allocate
resources to the affected regions.
